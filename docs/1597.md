# HTTP 中的网址编码

> 原文：<https://www.javatpoint.com/url-encoding-in-http>

使用 ASCII 字符集通过互联网发送的 HTTP 网址。在网址编码中，执行以下操作:

1.将所有“不安全”字符转换为“%xx”，其中 xx 是十六进制字符的 ASCII 值。

2.所有的空间都变成了加号。

3.用=和&

**例**

```

name1=value1&name2=value2&name3=value3

```

4.对于 POST 提交，字符串将是我们的消息体，对于 GET 提交，查询字符串将是我们的消息体。

下表显示了字符及其替换的 ASCII 符号。在将符号传递给服务器之前，可以在 URL 中使用这些符号替换:
